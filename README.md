# Security Testing Final

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing a **Code Security Audit** of a previous project.  
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, associate them with insecure coding practices,  
and implement secure coding techniques to mitigate risks. The project includes peer code reviews,  
GitHub Actions for vulnerability testing, and the use of dedicated security testing tools.

## Features

- **Security Audit**: Identify and document vulnerabilities.
- **Peer Code Review**: Conduct peer reviews to find insecure coding practices.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate security scans with GitHub Actions.
- **Security Testing Tools**: Use appropriate tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP Top 10**: Map vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 categories and provide mitigation steps.
