# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Debugging Employee Creation (CRUD Operations)

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employee_controller.py`, Line 6 (Inside the `create_employee` function)
- **Objective:** Investigate how new employee records are created, ensuring correct data validation and database insertion.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
    - request_body: Contains employee data. Example: {"name": "John Doe", "role": "Software Engineer", "department": "Engineering"}
    - validated_data: Ensures data passes validation checks. Example: {"name": "John Doe", "role": "Software Engineer", "department": "Engineering"}
    - db_response: Confirms whether the insertion was successful. Example: { "status": "success", "message": "Employee created successfully" }
- **Call Stack:**
    - create_employee() → validate_employee_data() → insert_into_db()
- **Behavior:**
    - Debugger confirms if validation passes and the record is inserted correctly.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
    - Verified that input data is correctly structured. Validation checks work as expected.
- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
    - Missing fields cause validation failures, preventing the creation of incomplete records.
- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
    - Implement better error logging for validation failures, particularly to pinpoint missing or invalid fields.
- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
    - Understanding the importance of input validation and ensuring the process flows smoothly from validation to insertion.

## Scenario 2: Debugging Get All Branches (Branch Retrieval Logic)

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branch_controller.py`, Line 15 (Inside the `get_all_branches` function)
- **Objective:** Verify that all branch records are correctly retrieved from the database.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
    - branch_list: Array of all branches retrieved. 
    - db_response: Confirms whether the retrieval was successful. Example: { "status": "success", "message": "Branches fetched successfully" }
- **Call Stack:**
    - get_all_branches() → fetch_from_db()
- **Behavior:**
    - Confirms if branches are retrieved successfully.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
    - Validated that all branches are retrieved correctly.
- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
    - No unexpected behavior observed.
- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
    - No fallback messaging when no branches are found.
- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
    - Validates that retrieval logic is working but highlights the need for user feedback when no branches exist.

## Scenario 3: Debugging Employee Retrieval by Branch (Logical Relationships)

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branch_controller.py`, Line 37 (Inside `get_employees_by_branch`)
- **Objective:** Verify that employees are correctly retrieved for a given branch.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
    - branch_id: The ID of the branch being queried.
    - employee_list: Array of employees expected to belong to the branch. Example: {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "role": "Software Engineer"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "role": "Product Manager"}
- **Call Stack:**
    - get_employees_by_branch() → fetch_from_db()
- **Behavior:**
    - Debugger confirms whether the query returns expected employees.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
    - Found that incorrect branch IDs return empty lists, which helps pinpoint why certain branch queries fail.
- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
    - Observed that the query doesn’t handle cases where no employees exist for a branch, leading to a lack of error messaging.
- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
    - Implement fallback messaging or error handling when no employees are found for a given branch.
- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
    - Reinforces the need for error handling when no data is found, ensuring that users are informed about missing records.
