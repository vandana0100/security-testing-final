# Employee Directory and Branch Management API

## Overview

The **Employee Directory and Branch Management API** is a robust back-end solution designed to securely and efficiently manage employee and branch data. This API incorporates advanced features such as input validation, persistent database integration, and comprehensive documentation, facilitating seamless integration into applications. By adhering to best practices in data security and performance, this API ensures high data integrity and reliability.

## Objective and Requirements

This project builds upon previous assignments by integrating several key advanced features:

- **Input Validation with Joi**: Ensures data security by validating every user input according to predefined rules.
- **Firestore Integration**: Replaces in-memory data handling with Firebase Firestore, a scalable and secure NoSQL database.
- **Advanced Documentation**: Provides clear, user-friendly API documentation to streamline developer integration.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implements secure management of configuration data using environment variables, Helmet.js, and other best practices.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Data Integrity**: Validating user inputs to ensure accurate and safe data processing.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Handling persistent data storage and retrieval with Firestore.
- **Clear Documentation**: Documenting the API using OpenAPI standards to ensure ease of use for developers.
- **Security Best Practices**: Incorporating measures to safeguard sensitive application data.

## Part 1: Joi Validation and Firestore Integration

### Data Validation with Joi

Joi is used to enforce strict rules on incoming data for employees and branches, ensuring:

- **Valid Data Processing**: Only valid data is processed, minimizing the risk of inconsistencies or malicious data injection.
- **Centralized Validation Rules**: Makes the validation logic easy to maintain and test.

#### Key Features of Joi Validation

- **Field Requirements**:
    - Example: An employee object must contain fields such as `name`, `position`, and `branch`, each with specific data types (e.g., strings, enumerations).
  
- **Validation Middleware**:
    - Middleware integrates with API routes to validate incoming data before it reaches the controllers.

- **Test Coverage**:
    - Validation rules are covered by tests to ensure they work as intended.

#### Example Joi Schema for Employee Data

```typescript
import Joi from 'joi';

const employeeSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required().min(3).max(50),
  position: Joi.string().required(),
  branch: Joi.string().required(),
});
```

### Firestore Database Integration

The project uses Firestore for persistent, scalable data management, replacing in-memory storage.

#### Firestore Features

- **Collections**: Employees and branches are stored in separate Firestore collections.
- **CRUD Operations**: The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both employees and branches.
- **Error Handling**: Firestore-specific errors (e.g., connection issues or invalid queries) are gracefully handled.

#### Example Firestore Integration

```typescript
import { Firestore } from '@google-cloud/firestore';

const db = new Firestore();
const employeeCollection = db.collection('employees');

// Add a new employee
async function addEmployee(employee) {
  await employeeCollection.add(employee);
}
```

### Error Handling

Advanced error-handling mechanisms include:

- **Validation Errors**: Joi validation errors are returned to the client with descriptive messages.
- **Database Errors**: Firestore errors are managed with meaningful feedback.
- **General Error Handling**: The `NextFunction` in Express handles errors consistently across the app.

## Part 2: Advanced API Documentation and Security Enhancements

### API Documentation

The API documentation is fully compliant with OpenAPI standards and generated using Swagger UI for an interactive, user-friendly experience.

#### Public Documentation

The public documentation provides:

- **Endpoint Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of what each endpoint does, including required inputs and expected outputs.
- **Example Requests and Responses**: Includes TypeScript examples for ease of integration.
- **Interactive Testing**: Developers can test endpoints directly within the Swagger UI.

#### Accessing Documentation

- **Public Version**: [Public API Documentation](https://vandana0100.github.io/my-api-documentation)
- **Local Access**: Run the API locally and visit `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` to access the Swagger UI documentation.

### Security Enhancements

Security is critical, and this project follows best practices to protect sensitive data.

#### Environment Variables

Sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, is stored securely using environment variables.

##### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add the following variables:

```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

3. Install and configure the `dotenv` package:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
```

#### Secure HTTP Headers with Helmet.js

The **Helmet.js** middleware is used to set secure HTTP headers to protect against vulnerabilities such as:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Clickjacking**
- **MIME type sniffing**

##### Example Usage of Helmet.js

```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use(helmet());
```

#### CORS Management

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow safe API access while blocking unauthorized requests.

## Conclusion

This project combines advanced back-end functionality with robust security and comprehensive documentation practices. By integrating **Joi validation**, **Firestore database management**, **OpenAPI documentation**, and **security enhancements**, the API offers a reliable, secure, and user-friendly solution for managing employee and branch data.
